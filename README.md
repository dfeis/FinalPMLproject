# FinalPMLproject
Final prediction assignment of Practical Machine Learning coursera course

Since there are many reported issues, please view the HTML via this link:
https://dfeis.github.io/FinalPMLproject/

To push the files to this repo, I used the instructions from this page:
https://github.com/lgreski/datasciencectacontent/blob/master/markdown/pml-ghPagesSetup.md

Since there is not ONE link to submit the assignment, I wrote 
"My repo is here and the compiled html is here" > click on here and use the button link to create a hyperlink
